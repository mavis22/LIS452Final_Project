      <description descriptionType="Other">The data refer only to males whose pathways were possible to identify in the cohorts 2000-2004. Comments to the excel table: On sheet "TL pathways": Pathway - life-history pathway followed by the male; TL switch - total length at the moment of switch from Sneaker to Nest-holder morphotype (the average TL value estimated  for the last time the male was seen as Sneaker and the first time that it was seem as Nest-holder ); switch month - mid point between the month in which the male was last seen as sneaker and the first month in which it was seen as a Nest -holder as long as these 2 dates were not more than 2 months apart; For each male the value of TL in presented for each of the census in which that male was captured and measured. Values are presented in cm. On sheet "reproductive success pathways": Pathway - life-history pathway followed by the male; TL 1st breeding season - average of total length during the first breeding season, age 0+/1; Lifetime eggs - sum of all eggs present inside the nest of the male for the whole time in which it was a Nest-holder (not corrected for the eggs that are ind^side the nest but are actually fertilized by other males, sneakers; also not taken into account ).</description>
