      <description descriptionType="Other">This file contains the list of articles covered by our literature review on alternative mating phenotypes (AMP) in insects. For our classification of AMPs: they can be conditional (C) or mendelian (Mend, pure genetic polymorphism); fixed (F) or reversible (R). We also included whether male morphology determines (D), influences (I) or is irrelevant (Irr) for the mating behaviour employed by individuals; and whether there is morphological dimorphism (Y for yes, N for no) among individuals. ? indicates uncertainty, whereas lack of information is omitted. Our review is based on a search of the literature (through Web of Science) using the key-words &#8216;alternative&#8217;, &#8216;mating&#8217;, &#8216;reproductive&#8217;, &#8216;tactic(s)&#8217;, &#8216;strategy(ies)&#8217;, and combinations thereof. Even though we focused here only in mating phenotypes, and not on other features of insect reproduction (such as oviposition strategies, for instance), we still included &#8216;reproductive&#8217; in our keywords because the usage of the term &#8216;alternative reproductive tactics/strategies&#8217; in the literature often encompasses AMPs. However, some studies describe the sort of intraspecific variation in mating phenotypes that falls under the umbrella of AMPs, without using any of the key-words mentioned above, and have likely been missed. Moreover, to restrict our literature search to studies on insects, we also used the keywords &#8216;insect(s)&#8217; and &#8216;Insecta&#8217;, and we might have missed studies that only treated their focal species by a common name. We therefore anticipate that our review is somewhat incomplete, and AMPs are probably even more widespread than currently recognized. We wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they were the rule, rather than the exception, in insect mating systems. Our review covered a total of 353 references, including journal articles and chapters in peer-reviewed books, published between 1934 and 2012.</description>
